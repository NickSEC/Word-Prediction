# Word-Prediction

A quick note - the data files take a bit of time to download, so when you type in your first phrase, it could take up to 20 seconds for the first word prediction to appear.  Word predictions after that are fast !

To run the shiny app, type the following in RStudio:

library(shiny)

runGitHub("Word-Prediction","NickSEC")
